Most AI image tools are either too complicated or too expensive. You're either wrestling with Photoshop-level complexity or paying $20/month for a subscription you barely use.

StaticKit is different. It's a powerful front-end for the best AI image models, designed to make professional editing fast and intuitive. No subscriptions—just pay pennies per edit directly to the AI provider.

## A Front-End for World-Class AI

StaticKit connects to Google's Gemini, one of the most capable AI image models available. But instead of writing prompts and wrestling with API documentation, you get a polished interface with smart features built in.

Think of it like the difference between coding a website from scratch versus using a website builder. Same powerful technology underneath, but dramatically easier to use.

You bring your own API key (free from Google), and StaticKit handles everything else: the prompt engineering, the UI, the workflow optimization.

## One-Click Presets That Actually Work

The fastest way to edit in StaticKit is with presets. Instead of describing exactly what you want, click a preset and let StaticKit construct the perfect prompt.

**Lighting presets** transform the mood instantly. Golden hour, studio lighting, dramatic shadows—one click each.

**Style presets** apply consistent aesthetics. Film grain, clean and modern, moody and cinematic.

**Enhancement presets** fix common issues. Sharpen details, reduce noise, boost colors naturally.

Behind each preset is carefully engineered prompt logic that maintains your subject while applying the style. This is harder than it sounds—naive prompts often distort faces or change important details. StaticKit's presets are tuned to avoid these problems.

## Background Swap in Seconds

Need to change where your photo was taken? StaticKit's background replacement is remarkably good.

Upload a photo of someone in front of a white wall. Type "sunny beach at golden hour" or "modern office with city view" or "cozy coffee shop." StaticKit extracts your subject, generates the new environment, and blends them together with matching lighting.

This used to require hours in Photoshop with manual masking. Now it's a 30-second operation.

## Model Swap for Product Photos

This is where StaticKit really shines for e-commerce and marketing.

Have a product photo with one model? Generate variations with different people without a reshoot. StaticKit can maintain the pose, clothing, and product placement while changing the person.

This lets you test which demographics respond to which creative—without booking multiple photo shoots.

## Version History That Makes Sense

Every edit in StaticKit creates a new version. You can see your entire editing journey, compare versions side-by-side, and branch off in different directions.

Made a change you don't like? Go back two versions and try something different. Want to see how the golden hour version compares to the studio lighting version? Put them next to each other.

This non-destructive workflow means you never lose good work experimenting with new ideas.

## Smart Aspect Ratio Resizing

Need the same image for Instagram (square), Stories (9:16), and your website (16:9)?

StaticKit's smart resize doesn't just crop—it intelligently extends your image to fit new dimensions. The AI generates additional content that matches the original seamlessly.

One source image, unlimited output formats.

## Natural Language Editing

Sometimes you know exactly what you want. Just describe it.

"Make her shirt blue instead of red."
"Remove the coffee cup from the table."
"Add some clouds to the sky."
"Make the whole image feel warmer and more inviting."

StaticKit translates your plain English into the precise prompts that get results. No prompt engineering required on your end.

## Why It's Free (Really)

StaticKit is free because you bring your own AI. You get an API key from Google (also free to start), and you pay Google directly for what you use—typically a few cents per edit.

There's no subscription, no credits that expire, no "premium tier" with the good features locked away.

We make StaticKit because we use it ourselves and wanted something better than what existed. The BYOK model means we don't need to charge you to keep the lights on.
